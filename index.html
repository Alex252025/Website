    <p><h3>8/25/23 - My first entry</h3></p>
    <p>Today was the first activity that we have done in class. First, we reviewed all of the safety rules, including wearing proper safety equipment like goggles and clothes. Then, we went over the engineering process, and started to learn about the different ways of creating and making things better through revision and innovation. Lastly, we went outside and did an activity, which consisted of using teamwork to roll a ball through pipes into a bucket. This activity demonstrated how we needed to work together and try many times before we could successfully complete the task.</p>
