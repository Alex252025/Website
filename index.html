    <center><h3>8/25/23 - My first entry</h3></center>
    <p><center>Today was the first activity that we have done in class. First, we reviewed all of the safety rules, including wearing proper safety equipment like goggles and clothes. Then, we went over the engineering process, and started to learn about the different ways of creating and making things better through revision and innovation. Lastly, we went outside and did an activity, which consisted of using teamwork to roll a ball through pipes into a bucket. This activity demonstrated how we needed to work together and try many times before we could successfully complete the task.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last couple of weeks, we have started our unit on mechanical engineering. We started by watching a short video on mechanical engineering, which reviewed the uses of it and its products over human history. Next, we reviewed slides on the topic, and took a short quiz on its uses and sub-sections. Meanwhile, while we were doing this, we started on our unit project, our own Rube Goldberg machine. After teaming up and forming our design on Tinkercad (picture attached), we started to build our design. we will continue into next week to finish our project.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last week and a half, we have been working on bringing our Tinkercad design to life. We had to make MANY adjustments in order to make it successful. We started by making our columns and ramps, in order to have a framework for our design. Then, we started to have problems. Our pulley buckets were not hanging right, and we had to find a way to keep them facing up in order to catch the marbles. Also, the pulley was very tense, and we had to use 12 marbles just for it to slide fast enough. However, we figured it out by taping string to all 4 sides of the pulley,so it would stay balanced. After, that, we had to completely revise our design. We made our design so that the second pulley bucket would bump the following platform, causing a marble to roll down a ramp, all the way until it hit a lever, which turned and popped the balloon. Everything worked relatively smoothly, except for the fact that sometimes the second bucket was not rising fast enough to bumo the marble down the ramp. We solved this problem by adding a few marbles into the first bucket beforehand, so the added weight would increase the acceleration. Attached is a video of our final test.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last week, we have started our computer engineering unit. First, we watched a video on the basics of computer engineering, and completed a worksheet based on the video. Then we started to do some desktop dissections. We took some old desktops and took them apart, identifying each part of the computer as we took it apart. This included the CPU, RAM, hard drive, battery, GPU, etc. Then, we put it all back together, and tested if they still worked by plugging them in and turning them on. It was very interesting. Below is a picture of the dissected computer.</center></p>

    <center><p>After we finished up our computer engineering unit with our computer dissections, we started our bioengineering unit. This includes many different parts of science, especially biomimicry and the creation of prosthetic limbs. For example, NASA and other research organizations have studied animals like the gecko and the mantis shrimp, to try and copy their incredible abilities, such as clinging to anything and punching something as hard and fast as a bullet being shot from a gun. Also, prosthetics are an example of bioengineering. They are designed to help people with missing limbs. Scientists are constantly trying to find ways to improve these designs to be more functional and useful in a disabled person's life. In fact, this is the project that we did in class on Wednesday. We made a hand out of carboard that a human could operate to pick up an empty water bottle. Uploaded is a video of my group operating our prototype.</p></center>

    <center><h3>10/20/23</h3></center>
    <center><p>We wrapped up our bioengineering unit relatively quickly, and moved onto the aerospace unit. We learned a lot about the different kinds of vessels that travel through the air, like missles, rockets, airplanes ,spaceships, satellites and more. On top of that, we learned about the different forces that cause things to fly, and some history of the invention of airplanes. Then, we moved onto our project for this unit. We built bottle rockets out of 2-liter bottles, adding a tip at the top and stabilizing wings. After forming our design on our CAD, (picture included below) we began our assembly of our rocket. It only took about one class period to complete. Finally, today, we put our rocket to use, and launched it. Our rocket did fairly well, and went the second furthest out of everybody. This ends our aerospace unit, and we will move on starting next week. Attached is a video of our rocket flying.</p></center>
