    <center><h3>8/25/23 - My first entry</h3></center>
    <p><center>Today was the first activity that we have done in class. First, we reviewed all of the safety rules, including wearing proper safety equipment like goggles and clothes. Then, we went over the engineering process, and started to learn about the different ways of creating and making things better through revision and innovation. Lastly, we went outside and did an activity, which consisted of using teamwork to roll a ball through pipes into a bucket. This activity demonstrated how we needed to work together and try many times before we could successfully complete the task.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last couple of weeks, we have started our unit on mechanical engineering. We started by watching a short video on mechanical engineering, which reviewed the uses of it and its products over human history. Next, we reviewed slides on the topic, and took a short quiz on its uses and sub-sections. Meanwhile, while we were doing this, we started on our unit project, our own Rube Goldberg machine. After teaming up and forming our design on Tinkercad (picture attached), we started to build our design. we will continue into next week to finish our project.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last week and a half, we have been working on bringing our Tinkercad design to life. We had to make MANY adjustments in order to make it successful. We started by making our columns and ramps, in order to have a framework for our design. Then, we started to have problems. Our pulley buckets were not hanging right, and we had to find a way to keep them facing up in order to catch the marbles. Also, the pulley was very tense, and we had to use 12 marbles just for it to slide fast enough. However, we figured it out by taping string to all 4 sides of the pulley,so it would stay balanced. After, that, we had to completely revise our design. We made our design so that the second pulley bucket would bump the following platform, causing a marble to roll down a ramp, all the way until it hit a lever, which turned and popped the balloon. Everything worked relatively smoothly, except for the fact that sometimes the second bucket was not rising fast enough to bumo the marble down the ramp. We solved this problem by adding a few marbles into the first bucket beforehand, so the added weight would increase the acceleration. Attached is a video of our final test.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last week, we have started our computer engineering unit. First, we watched a video on the basics of computer engineering, and completed a worksheet based on the video. Then we started to do some desktop dissections. We took some old desktops and took them apart, identifying each part of the computer as we took it apart. This included the CPU, RAM, hard drive, battery, GPU, etc. Then, we put it all back together, and tested if they still worked by plugging them in and turning them on. It was very interesting. Below is a picture of the dissected computer.</center></p>

    <center><h3>10/6/23</h3></center>
    <center><p>After we finished up our computer engineering unit with our computer dissections, we started our bioengineering unit. This includes many different parts of science, especially biomimicry and the creation of prosthetic limbs. For example, NASA and other research organizations have studied animals like the gecko and the mantis shrimp, to try and copy their incredible abilities, such as clinging to anything and punching something as hard and fast as a bullet being shot from a gun. Also, prosthetics are an example of bioengineering. They are designed to help people with missing limbs. Scientists are constantly trying to find ways to improve these designs to be more functional and useful in a disabled person's life. In fact, this is the project that we did in class on Wednesday. We made a hand out of carboard that a human could operate to pick up an empty water bottle. Uploaded is a video of my group operating our prototype.</p></center>

    <center><h3>10/20/23</h3></center>
    <center><p>We wrapped up our bioengineering unit relatively quickly, and moved onto the aerospace unit. We learned a lot about the different kinds of vessels that travel through the air, like missles, rockets, airplanes ,spaceships, satellites and more. On top of that, we learned about the different forces that cause things to fly, and some history of the invention of airplanes. Then, we moved onto our project for this unit. We built bottle rockets out of 2-liter bottles, adding a tip at the top and stabilizing wings. After forming our design on our CAD, (picture included below) we began our assembly of our rocket. It only took about one class period to complete. Finally, today, we put our rocket to use, and launched it. Our rocket did fairly well, and went the second furthest out of everybody. This ends our aerospace unit, and we will move on starting next week. Attached is a video of our rocket flying.</p></center>

    <center><p>After finishing up our aerospace unit last last week, we started our environmental engineering unit. This unit focuses mainly onhow engineers can help to reduce the adverse effects of the environment on many aspects of our life, such as filtering water adn reducing CO2 in the atmosphere. We reviewed the slide show and watched some videos last class period, and today we conducted a project. Our task was to construct a water filtration system that could transform a cup of muddy, dirty water into cleaner, possibly drinkable water. We were given liter bottles, and cotton balls, sand, small rocks and big rocks. We then attempted to layer them in such a way that the dirty water would flow through them and come out clean. After multiple attempts, we realized that the rocks and sand were partially contaminated from previous dirt that was present in their respective bags, so we first rinsed these materials before building our filter. This was very successful, and worked wonderfully. Attached is a picture of our filter.</p></center>

    <center><p>We started our electrical engineering unit yesterday after we finished our environmental engineering quiz. This unit includes many labs and other activities. We started learning about currents, voltage, resistance, etc., and how they affect electricity flow and other factors. Tinkercad, the same website we used to make our bottle rocket and Rube Goldberg machine designs on, has an electricity section, where you can test different labs and other things. Yesterday, we tested a lab on turning on LED lights, and making series and parallel chains. We will continue to do labs and expirements within this unit in the next week or two, as we have many materials and supplies available to us as far as this unit. Attached is a picture of a Tinkercad lab I did.</p></center>

    <center><h3>11/13/23</h3></center>
    <center><p>We have been doing labs for the last week, including experimenting with Tinkercad and making different circuits, including series and parallel circuits, and using resistors and arduinos. We have done 4 labs so far, and have even used breadboards in real life and lighted up LEDs. the unti has been very fun so far. My partners and I took some pictures, but have been having trouble uploading them, so they will be there soon.</p></center>
    <center><h3>12/1/23</h3></center>
    <center><p>After finishing up our electrical unit, we moved on into one of the last units of the semester: business engineering. In this unit, we learned about the different aspects of the buiness section of engineering, including project managment, marketing, user experience, etc. Our project for this unit was to make a slidedeck and do a busines pitch with the slideshow. My group's pitch was for bluetooth basketballs. Attached is a screenshot of one of our slides.</p></center>

    <center><p>The last month and a half have been quite interesting. Our school got hacked by a company called Medusa in December, and all of our school issued devices and School Wifi have been down. Everything is almost fixed now, so we finally got to get back on our devices. Since the business engineering unit, we started our final unit of the year, civil engineering. OUr cumulative project was building a bridge out of dry spaghetti and wood glue. The objective was to design a bridge with 40 spaghettis or less, and create a bridge that held a lot of weight while staying as light as possible. The following is a list of responses to an analysis of our bridge.</p></center>
    <center><b>Bridge Analysis</b></center>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Our bridge weighed 42.2 grams. Most of this weight came from glue, as we needed to use a lot of glue to keep our bridge sturdy.</li>
        <li>Our bridge held 791.6 grams of water. This was a lot more than we expected it to hold, so we were fairly happy.</li>
        <li>Our ratio of water held to bridge weight was 18.75. We did not have the highest score of the class, but we still did fairly well.</li>
        <li>The heaviest part of our bridge was the base, because we fortified it with glue. The glue was quite heavy.</li>
        <li>Our design was based on prior knowledge of the fact that triangles are some of the strongest shapes there are, so we attempted to design our bridge mainly with triangular shapes. We made a rectangular base with two sides made of triangles. the triangles contributed to the sturdiness of the bridge.</li>
        <li>The design worked relatively well. It was not exactly like we expected, but it was not horrible. The only problem was that we had trouble lining up the different pieces of our bridge so they could hold more weight. This is what we would try to fix if we could redo it.</li>
        <li>The point of failure on our bridge was the edges. Our bridge had two weak spots on each side where there was a very thin layer of spaghetti that we were holding it by. This is where our bridge snapped. This is exactly where we expectecd it to break.</li>
        <li>We could specifically measure each piece so they all line up perfectly and hold more weight. We could also extend our triangular side walls so the holding points become more sturdy and do not snap. I think that if we did that, the bridge would inevitably weight more, but we would be able to hold much more wate rthan our original bridge did.</li>

    <center><p>Today we started our Chemical Engineering unit. This unit is relatively short. We learned about different careers, and also did a project where me made ooblek, a type of substance where cornstarch and water are mixed together. After they are mixed, they form a substance where when pressure is applied, it acts like a solid, but when it is settled, it acts like a liquid. The goal of this project was to measure the right amount of water to maximize the texture of the ooblek. Attached is a video of me holding the ooblek.</p></center>

    <center><p>Now that we have started our second semester, we are starting some bigger projects. Over the next six weeks, we will construct a mousetrap car, and design it to go the furthest distance possible. So far, over the last two weeks, we have proposed our project, and have completed a template to get started. After completing these, we started a CAD of our mousetrap car, and made it perfectly to scale. Strating tomorrow, we will hopefully start our construction of the car. Attached is a picture of our CAD.</p></center>
    <center><img src="MousetrapCAD.png" height=300 width=400></center>
    <center><h3>2/9/24</h3></center>
    <center><p>We finished our first iteration of our mousetrap car today. We followed our CAD almost exactly. The only part that we had to change was adding popsicle sticks to the bottom of the car, so that we could set the mousetrap without bending the body of the car, which was weaker and made out of cardboard. Our prediction for our car's total distance travelled was 190 inches, which we based on our calculations of our ratio of wheel to axle circumfrence and string length. Our car was actually very close to the projected distance; it traveled 199 inches. On our second iteration, we are going to try our best to make sure that the wheels are aligned well, and that the car goes straighter. In our first iteration, the wheels were very wobbly, and they caused the car to move side to side and not go as straight as we would have wanted it to. We might also try to extend the length of the car so that the rod is longer and pulls more string. By pulling more string, the car can move forward more. We will try to reverse engineer this process to make our car go at least 300 inches. Pictures/videos will be uploaded next time.</p></center>
