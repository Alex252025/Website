    <p><h3>8/25/23 - My first entry</h3></p>
    <p><center>Today was the first activity that we have done in class. First, we reviewed all of the safety rules, including wearing proper safety equipment like goggles and clothes. Then, we went over the engineering process, and started to learn about the different ways of creating and making things better through revision and innovation. Lastly, we went outside and did an activity, which consisted of using teamwork to roll a ball through pipes into a bucket. This activity demonstrated how we needed to work together and try many times before we could successfully complete the task.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last couple of weeks, we have started our unit on mechanical engineering. We started by watching a short video on mechanical engineering, which reviewed the uses of it and its products over human history. Next, we reviewed slides on the topic, and took a short quiz on its uses and sub-sections. Meanwhile, while we were doing this, we started on our unit project, our own Rube Goldberg machine. After teaming up and forming our design on Tinkercad (picture attached), we started to build our design. we will continue into next week to finish our project.</center></p>
