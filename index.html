    <p><h3>8/25/23 - My first entry</h3></p>
    <p><center>Today was the first activity that we have done in class. First, we reviewed all of the safety rules, including wearing proper safety equipment like goggles and clothes. Then, we went over the engineering process, and started to learn about the different ways of creating and making things better through revision and innovation. Lastly, we went outside and did an activity, which consisted of using teamwork to roll a ball through pipes into a bucket. This activity demonstrated how we needed to work together and try many times before we could successfully complete the task.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last couple of weeks, we have started our unit on mechanical engineering. We started by watching a short video on mechanical engineering, which reviewed the uses of it and its products over human history. Next, we reviewed slides on the topic, and took a short quiz on its uses and sub-sections. Meanwhile, while we were doing this, we started on our unit project, our own Rube Goldberg machine. After teaming up and forming our design on Tinkercad (picture attached), we started to build our design. we will continue into next week to finish our project.</center></p>

    <p><center>Over the last week and a half, we have been working on bringing our Tinkercad design to life. We had to make MANY adjustments in order to make it successful. We started by making our columns and ramps, in order to have a framework for our design. Then, we started to have problems. Our pulley buckets were not hanging right, and we had to find a way to keep them facing up in order to catch the marbles. Also, the pulley was very tense, and we had to use 12 marbles just for it to slide fast enough. However, we figured it out by taping string to all 4 sides of the pulley,so it would stay balanced. After, that, we had to completely revise our design. We made our design so that the second pulley bucket would bump the following platform, causing a marble to roll down a ramp, all the way until it hit a lever, which turned and popped the balloon. Everything worked relatively smoothly, except for the fact that sometimes the second bucket was not rising fast enough to bumo the marble down the ramp. We solved this problem by adding a few marbles into the first bucket beforehand, so the added weight would increase the acceleration. Attached is a video of our final test.</center></p>
